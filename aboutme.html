    <p class="c">Hello reader, my name is Nathania Thornill, a student
    of one of the top schools in one of the Caribbean islands.</p>
    <p class="c">From since I was younger, I have had an overall dream
    of wanting to help the less fortunate, homeless and those in need;
    so this website is and has been a dream project of mine for a long
    time now.</p>
    <p class="c">I am a curious learner with many hobbies.
    Those I do often are drawing, crafting, writing, cooking and
    playing some sports. I usually play netball, basketball and
    or track events.</p>
