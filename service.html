    <h3 class="b">[Who are those who suffer?]</p>
    <p class="c">Most times when someone mentions a person who is
    suffering, we automatically think of someone who is homeless
    or has just lost a job or loved one. Though those are some
    examples of one who has suffered from an unfortunate situation,
    going through an unfortunate situation includes many more factors,
    especially the aftermath. The results of this are most times, a
    mental issue, a setback with time or plans and or any other health
    issues.</p>
    <br>
    <p class="c">There is a YouTube channel out there named, 'AnthonyPadilla'
    who mostly covers interviews of different types of videos and by luck he has
    done two, made just for your viewing. They are quite legnthy but are worth
    the watch.</p>

    <p class="c">These two videos depict those who suffered from a situation but survived.<br>
      We can do this the same way, not in the same manner shown in the video but to help those
      who suffer to refrain from these situations. It takes a lot of guts to put such an event
      live on the internet but the amount of lives you inspire and help will save that lost.</p>
