  <!-- Page Introduction -->
  <p class="a">In today's world, many unpredicitable events occur,
     most times it is a great friend or companion we lost
     or we miss a special thing. For some, things like these
     seem worthless but there are others who suffer a greater
     cause. We saw them at least once in our lives or heard a
     past person's story but it is sickening to see no change occur.
     Most of these unfortunate events are though poverty, homelessness,
     death or some sort of lose.</p>

  <h3>[Why are people selfish to those in need?]</h3>
  <p class="b">Nowadays, when it comes to helping one in need or doing a favor, we are quick
  to avoid the chance and give a poor excuse of not helping them out. Most believe there is a
  good reason for everything but that is not always the case. It takes only a few seconds to
  a few minutes to give or even donate to a cause, but we, 'never find the time' to. We
  should think more about the results and not the amount we will lose. Below is a video that
  sends a great message:
