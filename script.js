a thoughtful regard for others or an act of thoughtfulness. Treat others
with the same feeling you would want to be treated with. Having such a golden
rule is  sometimes forgotten and only remembered when looked back at or
reminded of. With having just a bit of consideration cause a great deal for
looking at others in a lower level than us.] ["Assumstions" , When one hears
about another suffering we automatically think of something major. 'It must be
the death of a loved one' or 'Is it another natural disatster this place got
struck by?' The meaning of suffer in fact means to experience or be subjected
to something bad or unpleasant. So suffering does not only mean a job lost or
a divorce, it also means going through something mentally disturbing or even
having overall negative emotions because of a certain situation.]
["Your Help Can Pay" , In the world, there are so many people we see who are
suffering; with the naked eye, we see a homeless person but sometimes that one
joyful co-worker or that kid at school who is the 'loner' of the class is suffering
as well, so no matter who you see think twice about that positive action you want
to do to help them.] ["Treasuring Your Actions And Not Just Value Them" , There
are some people who will help, they will contribute, but their intentions are
different. Some may do it for fame or recognition others may do it out of boredom
but you can never know what one's true intentions are.]]
